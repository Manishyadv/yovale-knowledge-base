# Save credit card data

**Saving credit card data without charging the customer**

It's possible to save the customer's credit card for later use, without charging the customer immediately.  
  
You can do this by creating a save card form. This form creates a Stripe customer object which may contain not just the card data but billing address, shipping address, and also custom fields.  
  
The saved cards are listed on the "Full Stripe -&gt; Saved Cards -&gt; Saved Cards" page in WP admin.
