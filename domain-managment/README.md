#### 6. Now, you domain is connected to your  Yovale website but you have to change your DNS setting in registrar account, please follow these steps to configure domain:-

**To connect your domain:**

a. Log in to your registrar account

The registrar is where you originally purchased the domain. If you don't remember who your registrar is, you can use [whois.net](http://whois.net/) to find out.

b. Locate the Control Panel or Domain Manager of your domain in your registrar account.

 The control panel allows you to change the DNS records from the default ones provided by the registrar.

 Different registrars may have different control panel layouts and other names for it as well. You         might find it under 'DNS Manager' or 'Domain Manager".



### 7. In your registrar's Control Panel, change the A record and the CNAME:

A record -        Host --&gt; @           points to --&gt; 34.202.63.170

**CNAME -         Host --&gt; WWW                    points to --&gt; yourdomainname.com**

Make sure to **SAVE** these changes. 





**Few important notes:**

a\) It may take up to 24 hours for these changes to propagate worldwide.

b\) If there are previous A records in your DNS settings - make sure to delete them.
