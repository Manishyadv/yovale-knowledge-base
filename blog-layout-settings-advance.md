# Blog layout settings Advance

You can enable additional layout settings in the Yovale customizer to style specific archive types & custom post type archives differently than the rest of the blog.  


To enable additional layout settings in the Yovale customizer, navigate to _Appearance -&gt; Theme Settings_ in the Yovale dashboard.  


### Layouts



All available layouts have their own, specific layout & design options. With the grid layout for instance, you can:

* choose how many posts you want to display for each device
* change the grid gap
* apply a masonry effect
* & more
